Excel Dashboard Project

This project involved creating a dashboard in Excel to visualize data about bike buyers. The dashboard includes three visualizations:

A bar chart showing the number of bike buyers in each age bracket.
A column chart showing the average commute distance of bike buyers, broken down by whether or not they purchased a bike.
A line chart showing the number of bike buyers in each age bracket, broken down by whether or not they purchased a bike.
The dashboard also includes filters for marital status, region, and education, which allow users to explore the data in different ways.
